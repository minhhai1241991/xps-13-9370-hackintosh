# xps-13-9370-hackintosh (repo in construction)
* Big thanks to the [OpenCore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) and @QuantumShqipe's [hackintosh](https://github.com/QuantumShqipe/OpenCore-0.6.3-XPS-13-9370-BigSur)
* My laptop hardware information could be found at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ngfuong/910a94c33bd650a20fe4913a2d57e547)

# What's working?
* **Almost everything**
* **External speakers**: ALC3271 is not supported so I injected [VoodooHDA](https://github.com/chris1111/VoodooHDA-OC) instead.
* **Wifi USB Adapter**: TENDA W311-MI with [Big Sur Adapter](https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Big-Sur-Adapter)

# What's not working? (updating...)
* Internal wifi card
* Headphone jack (black right)
